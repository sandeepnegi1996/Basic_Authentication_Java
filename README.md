# Authentication From Scratch
So This guide is basically a practice guide and I will code the Authentication from Scratch Step by Step

## Steps 
    1.Compare both username and password to hardcoded values
    2.Add the ability to handle multiple users
    3.Use hashing to keep our passwords secure
    4.Store user credentials in a separate configuration file
    5.Store user credentials in a database


### Tracking

- [x] Compare both username and password to hardcoded values  (step1)
- [x] Add the ability to handle multiple users                (step1)
- [x] Use hashing to keep our passwords secure                (step2)
- [ ] Store user credentials in a separate configuration file  (Authentication folder)
- [ ] Store user credentials in a database                    (using Database folder)
